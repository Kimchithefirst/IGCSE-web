   - Organized by IGCSE subjects and topics
   - Includes notes, summaries, and explanatory content
   - Supports multimedia content (text, images, videos)

2. **Interactive Practice Tests**
   - Subject-specific quizzes and tests
   - Mock exam simulations with timing
   - Instant feedback and explanations for answers

3. **Progress Tracking System**
   - Personal dashboard showing completion status
   - Performance analytics and improvement suggestions
   - Study schedule recommendations

4. **User Management**

# Technical Architecture  
1. **Frontend**
   - React.js for component-based UI development
   - Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop access

2. **Backend**
   - Node.js/Express for API endpoints
   - MongoDB for storing user data and progress
   - Authentication using JWT tokens
   - RESTful API architecture

3. **Data Models**
   - User: student profiles, authentication info, progress data
   - Content: study materials organized by subject/topic
   - Assessments: quizzes, practice tests, and exam simulations
   - Analytics: performance metrics and tracking data

# Development Roadmap  
1. **Phase 1: MVP Foundation**
   - Basic user authentication system
   - Core content management for study materials
   - Simple quiz functionality for one subject
   - Basic user dashboard with minimal progress tracking

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Learning Experience**
   - Expanded content for multiple IGCSE subjects
   - Advanced quiz and test functionality
   - Detailed progress analytics
   - Improved UI/UX with responsive design

3. **Phase 3: Full Platform**
   - Complete subject coverage
   - Advanced exam simulation
   - Teacher/parent monitoring features
   - Integration with additional learning resources

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation First**
   - Set up project structure and core dependencies
   - Implement authentication and user management
   - Create basic content management system

2. **Content Before Assessment**
   - Implement study materials interface
   - Build content creation/management tools
   - Establish content organization by subject/topic

3. **Assessment and Progress**
   - Develop quiz/test functionality
   - Implement scoring and feedback systems
   - Create progress tracking and analytics

4. **Refinement and Expansion**
   - Enhance UI/UX based on initial feedback
   - Expand to additional subjects
   - Add advanced features and optimizations

# Risks and Mitigations  
1. **Content Quality and Accuracy**
   - Risk: Inaccurate or outdated educational content
   - Mitigation: Implement content review process, version control for materials

2. **User Engagement**
   - Risk: Students lose interest or find platform difficult to use
   - Mitigation: Focus on intuitive design, gamification elements, regular feedback cycles

3. **Performance Under Load**
   - Risk: System slowdown during peak exam seasons
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, optimize database queries, consider serverless architecture

4. **Data Security**
   - Risk: Student data privacy concerns
   - Mitigation: Implement robust security measures, ensure GDPR compliance

# Appendix  
1. **IGCSE Subject Categories**
   - Sciences: Biology, Chemistry, Physics
   - Mathematics
   - Languages: English, French, Spanish
   - Humanities: History, Geography
   - Business and Economics

2. **Learning Methodology**
   - Based on active recall and spaced repetition
   - Emphasis on understanding over memorization
   - Alignment with IGCSE examination board requirements
