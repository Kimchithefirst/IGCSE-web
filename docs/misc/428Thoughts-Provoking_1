PLAN MODE: According to these files (simplified - prd.md and scratchpad.md)@simplified-prd.md @scratchpad.md  and the current codebase, could you please raise several thought - provoking questions and find out the next most important task that I should plan for?




# Project Planning Analysis: Next Steps for IGCSE Mock Test Platform

After reviewing the `simplified-prd.md` and `.cursor/scratchpad.md` files along with the current implementation, I've identified several key areas for consideration in planning the next phase of development.

## Thought-Provoking Questions

1. **User Authentication & Profiles:**
   - How should we implement user authentication to balance security with ease of use for students?
   - What essential profile data should we collect while maintaining simplicity?
   - How will authentication integrate with the test history and progress tracking features?

2. **Data Persistence:**
   - How should we structure the database to effectively store test attempts and results?
   - What metrics should we track to provide meaningful progress insights?
   - How can we ensure data integrity between the test-taking and results-viewing processes?

3. **Test Variety & Depth:**
   - How can we enhance the current question types beyond multiple-choice and text answers?
   - What features would make the simulation more realistic for IGCSE preparation?
   - How should we handle more complex question types like diagrams or mathematical equations?

4. **Learning Analytics:**
   - What patterns should we identify to help students understand their knowledge gaps?
   - How can we visualize progress in a meaningful way that encourages continued use?
   - What reporting features would be most beneficial for students preparing for exams?

## Next Most Important Task Recommendation

Based on the PRD and current implementation, I recommend that the next most important task should be:

### Implement User Authentication and Test History Storage

This task is critical because:

1. It's a foundational feature mentioned in the PRD's core features (2.3 User Management)
2. It enables persistent storage of test results and history
3. It's required for implementing progress tracking features
4. It builds upon the recently completed immediate feedback functionality
5. It will provide value to users by allowing them to track their improvement over time

This task would involve:
- Setting up authentication routes and controllers in the backend
- Creating user registration and login interfaces
- Designing the database schema for storing user data and test history
- Implementing secure JWT-based authentication
- Connecting the existing test simulation and results pages to the authentication system
- Adding functionality to save test results to the user's history

Would you like a more detailed breakdown of this task with specific subtasks and success criteria for planning purposes?
