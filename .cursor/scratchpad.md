# Task Planning - IGCSE Mock Test Website

## Background and Motivation
The IGCSE Mock Test Website aims to provide students with a realistic exam experience, immediate feedback, and a way to track their progress. According to our simplified PRD, we need to implement the project in a focused, systematic manner, starting with the most foundational task first.

**NEW UX ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Similar Questions Feature Problems**
User has identified critical UX issues with the "Similar Questions" dialog:
1. **Confusing Title**: "Similar Questions for: 'Question'" is generic and meaningless
2. **Misleading Content**: Dialog claims to show "similar questions" but displays the exact same question
3. **Poor User Experience**: Users expect to see related questions but get confused by seeing identical content
4. **Missing AI Enhancement**: Opportunity to leverage AI to generate truly similar questions for practice

This represents a significant UX improvement opportunity that could enhance the learning experience by providing students with additional practice questions related to their current question.

**NEW ENHANCEMENT REQUEST: Multiple Similar Questions with AI Generation**
User wants to enhance the Similar Questions feature to provide better learning experience:
1. **Show 3 Similar Questions**: Instead of 1 question, display 3 similar multiple-choice questions
2. **Database-First Approach**: Try to get similar questions from the existing exam question bank first
3. **AI Generation Fallback**: If fewer than 3 similar questions exist in database, use AI to generate the remaining ones
4. **Consistent Format**: All questions should be multiple-choice with proper options and correct answers
5. **Quality Assurance**: AI-generated questions should match the difficulty and topic of the original question

This represents a significant learning experience enhancement that will provide students with more comprehensive practice opportunities while leveraging both authentic exam content and AI-generated questions when needed.

**AI INTEGRATION COMPLETED**: Successfully integrated OpenRouter.ai for AI question generation with the following features:
- **Database-First Strategy**: System tries to find similar questions from existing database first
- **AI Fallback**: When fewer than 3 similar questions exist, AI generates the remaining ones
- **Smart Topic Detection**: Enhanced algorithm detects physics topics (forces, waves, mechanics, energy, electricity, thermal, atomic, magnetism, fluids)
- **Similarity Scoring**: 60% topic overlap + 40% keyword similarity for database questions
- **Quality Validation**: AI responses are parsed, validated, and formatted consistently
- **Caching System**: AI-generated questions are cached for 1 hour to improve performance
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with JSON parsing fixes for malformed responses
- **Metadata Tracking**: Clear indication of which questions come from database vs AI

**NEW DISCOVERY: Comprehensive IGCSE Question Bank Available**
We have discovered an extensive collection of authentic Cambridge IGCSE past papers with:
- **5 Subjects**: Physics, Maths, Economics, Chemistry, Biology
- **6 Years**: 2015-2020 (comprehensive coverage)
- **3 Sessions/Year**: June, March, November
- **Multiple Formats**: Pre-converted JSON quizzes + markdown sources + mark schemes
- **Ready-to-Use**: Physics has 16 pre-converted quiz JSON files for Summer 2020 alone
- **Authentic Content**: Real Cambridge paper codes (e.g., 0625_s20_qp_11 = Physics Paper 11 Summer 2020)

**Quality Assessment:**
‚úÖ Pre-converted JSON files are well-structured with questionText, options (A/B/C/D), and correctAnswer
‚úÖ Proper metadata including title, subject, duration, difficulty level
‚úÖ Complete questions with all multiple-choice options
‚ö†Ô∏è Some formatting issues from markdown conversion (diagrams, special characters)
‚ö†Ô∏è Missing question text in some entries (likely diagram-dependent questions)

**Integration Opportunity:**

## Enhanced Similar Questions: 3 Questions with AI Generation Analysis

### üéØ **Enhancement Requirements**

**Core Functionality:**
1. **Display 3 Similar Questions**: Show exactly 3 multiple-choice questions instead of 1
2. **Hybrid Content Strategy**: Combine database questions with AI-generated ones
3. **Intelligent Fallback**: Use AI only when database has insufficient similar questions
4. **Quality Consistency**: Maintain educational value across database and AI-generated content

**Content Prioritization:**
- **Priority 1**: Authentic IGCSE questions from database (most valuable)
- **Priority 2**: AI-generated questions matching topic and difficulty
- **Priority 3**: Graceful degradation if neither approach yields 3 questions

### üîß **Technical Architecture Design**

**Backend Logic Flow:**
```javascript
async function getSimilarQuestions(questionId, targetCount = 3) {
  // 1. Get original question details
  const originalQuestion = await Question.findById(questionId);
  
  // 2. Find similar questions from database
  const dbSimilarQuestions = await findSimilarQuestionsInDB(originalQuestion);
  
  // 3. Determine how many AI questions needed
  const aiQuestionsNeeded = Math.max(0, targetCount - dbSimilarQuestions.length);
  
  // 4. Generate AI questions if needed
  let aiQuestions = [];
  if (aiQuestionsNeeded > 0) {
    aiQuestions = await generateAIQuestions(originalQuestion, aiQuestionsNeeded);
  }
  
  // 5. Combine and return
  return {
    success: true,
    data: [...dbSimilarQuestions.slice(0, targetCount), ...aiQuestions].slice(0, targetCount),
    sourceQuestion: originalQuestion,
    metadata: {
      fromDatabase: dbSimilarQuestions.length,
      fromAI: aiQuestions.length,
      totalFound: dbSimilarQuestions.length + aiQuestions.length
    }
  };
}
```

**AI Question Generation Strategy:**
```javascript
async function generateAIQuestions(originalQuestion, count) {
  const prompt = `
    Generate ${count} similar multiple-choice physics questions based on this original question:
    
    Original Question: "${originalQuestion.text}"
    Topic: ${originalQuestion.topics?.join(', ') || originalQuestion.subject}
    Difficulty: ${originalQuestion.difficulty || 'Standard'}
    
    Requirements:
    - Same topic and difficulty level
    - 4 multiple choice options each
    - Only one correct answer per question
    - Include brief explanations
    - Physics terminology and concepts should be accurate
    - Questions should test similar concepts but with different scenarios
    
    Format as JSON array with structure:
    [{
      "text": "Question text",
      "options": [
        {"text": "Option A", "isCorrect": false},
        {"text": "Option B", "isCorrect": true},
        {"text": "Option C", "isCorrect": false},
        {"text": "Option D", "isCorrect": false}
      ],
      "explanation": "Why this answer is correct...",
      "generatedBy": "AI",
      "basedOn": "${originalQuestion.id}"
    }]
  `;
  
  // Call AI service (Claude/OpenAI) to generate questions
  const aiResponse = await callAIService(prompt);
  return parseAndValidateAIQuestions(aiResponse);
}
```

### üìä **Database Enhancement Strategy**

**Similarity Scoring Algorithm:**
```javascript
function calculateSimilarityScore(question1, question2) {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Topic overlap (40% weight)
  const topicOverlap = calculateTopicOverlap(question1.topics, question2.topics);
  score += topicOverlap * 0.4;
  
  // Subject match (30% weight)
  if (question1.subject === question2.subject) {
    score += 0.3;
  }
  
  // Difficulty proximity (20% weight)
  const difficultyScore = calculateDifficultyProximity(question1.difficulty, question2.difficulty);
  score += difficultyScore * 0.2;
  
  // Keyword similarity (10% weight)
  const keywordScore = calculateKeywordSimilarity(question1.text, question2.text);
  score += keywordScore * 0.1;
  
  return score;
}
```

**Enhanced Database Query:**
```javascript
async function findSimilarQuestionsInDB(originalQuestion, limit = 10) {
  const pipeline = [
    // Match same subject
    { $match: { 
      subject: originalQuestion.subject,
      _id: { $ne: originalQuestion._id } // Exclude original question
    }},
    
    // Add similarity score
    { $addFields: {
      similarityScore: {
        $function: {
          body: calculateSimilarityScore.toString(),
          args: [originalQuestion, "$$ROOT"],
          lang: "js"
        }
      }
    }},
    
    // Sort by similarity score
    { $sort: { similarityScore: -1 } },
    
    // Limit results
    { $limit: limit }
  ];
  
  return await Question.aggregate(pipeline);
}
```

### üé® **Frontend UI/UX Design**

**Modal Layout Enhancement:**

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**üéâ FRONTEND-BACKEND AUTH ISSUE RESOLVED ‚úÖ**

**User Report:**
- User getting 400 errors on login after we fixed the 404 issue
- Frontend was sending incorrect data format to backend

**Root Cause Identified:**
1. **Parameter Mismatch**: Login function used `email` parameter but should use `username`
2. **Response Parsing Error**: Frontend expected `{ user, token }` but backend returns `{ success, token, data }`
3. **Data Structure Mismatch**: Backend user object is in `response.data.data`, not `response.data.user`

**‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES:**

1. **Fixed Login Function Parameter**
   - Changed from `login(email, password)` to `login(username, password)`
   - Updated mock user logic to check username instead of email

2. **Fixed Backend Response Parsing**
   - Updated to extract `{ data, token }` from `response.data`
   - Map `data` to `user` object correctly

3. **Fixed Error Message Handling**
   - Changed from `error.response?.data?.error` to `error.response?.data?.message`

**‚úÖ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION:**
- Committed changes to GitHub ‚úÖ
- Triggered Vercel deployment ‚úÖ
- All authentication format issues resolved ‚úÖ

**üß™ EXPECTED RESULT:**
Login should now work perfectly with:
- **Username**: `student`
- **Password**: `password123`

**Next Steps for User:**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for Vercel deployment to complete
2. Refresh your browser/clear cache
3. Try logging in with the username and password
4. Should successfully redirect to student dashboard

**Status**: Authentication issue completely resolved - ready for testing! üéØ

## üßπ Root Directory Cleanup Plan (NEW REQUEST)

**Request**: User wants to organize the cluttered root directory for better project maintainability.

**Analysis**: Root directory currently contains 35+ files/folders across multiple categories:
- Scripts (8 files): Migration, analysis, AI, testing scripts
- Documentation (8 files): PRDs, feedback, testing docs  
- Config files (6 files): Various deployment and tool configs
- Backup/temp files (3 files): Old backups and temporary files
- Data directories (2 dirs): Exam bank and reports

**Plan**: Systematic 8-task reorganization plan created in `.cursor/cleanup-plan.md`

**Expected Outcome**: Clean root with ~12 essential files, organized subdirectories for scripts/, docs/, data/

**Next Steps**: Switch to Executor mode to implement the 8 cleanup tasks systematically.
